# IMPORTANT: Cloning this repo:

1. Delete the `htdocs` folder. If you have anything in there save it somewhere else

2. Open the terminal at `xampfiles` and type: `git clone https://github.com/aldinalagic/COS10026-Group-Project.git htdocs` You want to do this because all contents in htdocs will be overrided with this repo's files instead.

3. You're all set!

You can find `xampfiles` folder when you click on `Open Application Folder` inside the XXAMP desktop interface, then just right-click and open the terminal there :)
